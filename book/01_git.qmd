Introduction — This file shows a compact workflow for initializing a Git repository, configuring identity, making commits, creating and pushing a feature branch to GitHub, and tagging a release. Replace placeholder values (for example `your-username`, `YourLastName`, `Your Name`, and the email) with your actual values before running these commands.

```{bash}
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/tools-in-action-YourLastName.git
```

The above commands initialize a new Git repository in the current directory (`git init`), rename the current branch to `main` (`git branch -M main` forces the rename), and add a remote named `origin` that points to a GitHub repository at the specified URL (`git remote add origin <url>`). Replace the URL placeholders with your GitHub username and repository name.

```{bash}
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "12345678+your_github_name@users.noreply.github.com"
```

These commands set the committer identity for this repository. `git config user.name` sets the display name recorded in commits and `git config user.email` sets the email address recorded in commits. Use `--global` to set these values for all repositories on the machine.

```{bash}
git add .
git commit -m "chore: scaffold Quarto book"
```

`git add .` stages all new, modified, and deleted files from the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit. `git commit -m "<message>"` creates a new commit with the staged changes and attaches the provided commit message. The example uses a Conventional Commit-style message but any message is valid.

```{bash}
git checkout -b feat/sql-chapter
git add book/05_sql_sqlite.qmd
git commit -m "docs(sql): add initial join examples"
git push -u origin feat/sql-chapter
```

`git checkout -b <branch>` creates a new branch and switches to it. `git add <path>` stages a specific file for commit. `git commit -m "<message>"` commits the staged change. `git push -u origin <branch>` pushes the new branch to the `origin` remote and sets the local branch to track the remote branch so future `git push`/`git pull` can be run without specifying the remote and branch.

```{bash}
git tag v1.0-tools-in-action
git push origin v1.0-tools-in-action
```

`git tag <name>` creates a tag at the current commit to mark a release or milestone. `git push origin <tag>` pushes that tag to the `origin` remote. To push all tags at once use `git push origin --tags` (not shown above).
